    {
      "question": "How are Elements on the periodic table organized?",
      "answer": "By similar physical and chemical properties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Elements with similar properties on the periodic table appear in what way?",
      "answer": "Vertical groups"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does it mean for an element to be <i>inert?</i>",
      "answer": "A chemical that is stable and unreactive under specified conditions"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a molecule?",
      "answer": "A group of atoms bonded together, representing the smallest fundamental unit of a chemical compound that can take part in a chemical reaction. It is the smallest unit of pure substance containing more than one atom. Usually more than one type of atom"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an atom?",
      "answer": "The basic unit of a chemical element"
    },
    {
      "question": "In what forms can an element be found in?",
      "answer": "An element can be found as a single atom, such as a helium atom, or as a molecule in which atoms as bonded such as an oxygen or nitrogen molecule"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can elements exist in more than one molecular form?",
      "answer": "Yes! For example:<br>Graphite (C<sub>6</sub>)<br>Diamond (C<sub>4</sub>)<br>C<sub>60</sub> ('Buckyball')<br>All are elemental carbon"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a compound?",
      "answer": "A compound is a substance formed when two or more chemical elements are chemically bonded together. A compound is made up of 2 or more different atoms; individual units are called molcules"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a mixture?",
      "answer": "A mixture contains two or more substances that are not chemically combined"
    },
    {
      "question": "In what two ways are compounds named?",
      "answer": "Common and systematic. For example:<br>H<sub>2</sub>O has the common name water but the systematic name dihydrogen monoxide<br>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on the other hand has the common name hydrogen peroxide but the systematic name dihydrogen dioxide"
    },
    {
      "question": "How are the prefixes for the systematic names of compounds derived?",
      "answer": "It is based on the number of atoms such as mono- for 1, di- or bi- for 2, tri- for three, etc..."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the rules for systematically naming compounds?",
      "answer": "The rules go as follows:<br><ul><li>Most metallic element first</li><li>'-ide' added to end of second element</li><li>'mono-' NOT added to first element</li></ul>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a chemical reaction?",
      "answer": "A process whereby substances described as reactants are transformed into different substances called products<br><br>reactants &rarr; products"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Law of the Conservation of matter?",
      "answer": "Matter is neither created nor destroyed"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> considered unbalanced?",
      "answer": "The equation is unbalanced for the number and type of atoms on both sides must be equal!<br>CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the structure of an atom?",
      "answer": "An atom is constructed in the following way:<br><ul><li>Protons which consist of a +1 charge</li><li>The Nucleus</li><li>Neutrons which have no charge</li><li>Electrons which have a -1 charge</li></ul>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the definition of 'Atomic Number?'",
      "answer": "The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom, which determines the chemical properties of an element and its place in the periodic table"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the definition of 'Atomic Mass Number?'",
      "answer": "The atomic mass number of an element is its number of protons plus its number of neutrons. Electrons have virtually no mass so they are excluded"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an element made up of?",
      "answer": "An element is made up of a single type of atom"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a 'Valence Electron?'",
      "answer": "A valence electron is an electron in the outermost shell of an atom"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'Octet Rule?'",
      "answer": "Atoms are most stable if they have a filled or empty outer layer of electrons. Aside from H and He, a filled layer contains 8 electrons or an octet"
    },
    {
      "question": "",
      "answer": ""
